          Over the past three years, I have had the privilege of working with
          top e-commerce businesses and startups, gaining invaluable expertise
          in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
          Additionally, I am proficient in Figma, Adobe XD, Photoshop,
          WordPress, and Shopify. My experience extends beyond technical
          expertiseâ€”I have successfully managed a team of four freelancers and
          collaborated with various dropshipping companies, playing a crucial
          role in their growth. Through these experiences, I have honed my team
          and communication skills, which I believe are vital for fostering a
          collaborative work environment.
